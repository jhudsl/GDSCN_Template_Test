Here is an example of including the _child_workspace_create.Rmd with cow::borrow_chapter() Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the plus icon near the top of left of the page. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future). Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with. Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated. We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data). For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated. Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. "],["workspaces.html", "Chapter 4 Workspaces 4.1 Clone a Workspace 4.2 Create a Workspace 4.3 Open a Workspace 4.4 Share a Workspace", " Chapter 4 Workspaces Modules about Terra Workspaces 4.1 Clone a Workspace Launch Terra Locate the Workspace you want to clone. If a Workspace has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in “MY WORKSPACES”. You can clone a Workspace that was shared with you to perform your own analyses. In the screenshot below, no Workspaces have been shared. If a Workspace hasn’t been shared with you, navigate to the “FEATURED” or “PUBLIC” Workspace tabs. Use the search box to find the Workspace you want to clone. Click the teardrop button on the far right next to the Workspace you want to clone. Click “Clone”. You can also clone the Workspace from the Workspace Dashboard instead of the search results. You will see a popup box appear. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Terra Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). Remember that each Workspace should have its own Billing Project. If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future).

Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. 4.2 Create a Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the plus icon near the top of left of the page. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace.

Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. 4.3 Open a Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. You are automatically directed to the “My Workspaces” tab. Here you can see any Workspaces that have been shared with you, along with your permission level. Reader means you can open the Workspace and see everything, but can’t do any computations or make any edits. Writer means you can run computations, which will charge costs to the Workspace’s Billing Project. Writers can also make edits to the Workspace. Owner is similar to Writer, but also allows you to control who can access the Workspace. Click on the name of a Workspace to open it. Opening and viewing a Workspace does not cost anything. When you open a Workspace, you are directed to the Workspace Dashboard. This generally has a description of the Workspace contents, as well as some useful details about the Workspace itself. From here you can navigate through the different tabs of the Workspace, and if you have sufficient permission, you can start running analyses. If you are only a Reader, you may need to “clone” (make your own copy) of the Workspace before you can start working. 4.4 Share a Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the name of the Workspace to open the Workspace. Opening a Workspace does not cost anything. Certain activities in the Workspace (such as running an analysis) will charge to the Workspace’s Billing Project. Workspace management (e.g. adding and removing members, editing the description) does not cost money. Click the circle with 3 dots on the right hand side to open the Workspace management menu. Click “Share” Enter the email address of the user you want to share the Workspace with. This must be the address associated with the account they are using to access Terra. Choose their permission level. Remember that all activity in the Workspace will be charged to the Workspace’s Billing Project, regardless of who conducts it, so only add members as “Writers” or “Owners” if they should be charging to the Workspace’s Billing Project. “Readers” can view all parts of the Workspace but cannot make edits or run analyses (i.e. they cannot spend money). They can also clone their own copy of the Workspace where they can conduct activity on their own Billing Project. Click “Save”. The user should now be able to see the Workspace when logged in to Terra. "],["billing.html", "Chapter 5 Billing 5.1 Create Google Billing Account 5.2 Add Terra to Google Billing Account 5.3 Create Terra Billing Project 5.4 Add Members to Google Billing Account 5.5 Set Alerts for Google Billing 5.6 View Spend for Google Billing", " Chapter 5 Billing Modules about billing and Billing Projects on Google Cloud Platform and Terra. 5.1 Create Google Billing Account Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven’t been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to “Try for Free.” Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your lab members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going direction to the billing console console.cloud.google.com/billing Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing. We will cover account management in greater detail below. At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the Create Account button. We recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source. 5.2 Add Terra to Google Billing Account This gives Terra permission to create projects and send charges to the Google Billing Account, and must be done by an administrator of the Google Billing Account. Terra needs to be added as a “Billing Account User”: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add Terra to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter terra-billing@terra.bio in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose “Billing Account User”. Click “SAVE”. 5.3 Create Terra Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. Make sure to use the same Google account that you used to set up Google Billing. If this is your first time logging in to Terra, you will need to accept the Terms of Service. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. On the Billing page, click the “+ CREATE” button to create a new Billing Project. If prompted, select the Google account to use. Make sure to use the same Google account that you used to set up Google Billing. If prompted, give Terra permission to manage Google Cloud Platform billing accounts. Enter a unique name for your Terra Billing Project and select the appropriate Google Billing Account. The name of the Terra Billing Project must: Only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens Start with a lowercase letter Not end with a hyphen Be between 6 and 30 characters Be unique across all Google Billing Projects The page doesn’t always update as soon as the billing project is created. If it’s been a couple of minutes and you don’t see a change, try refreshing the page. 5.4 Add Members to Google Billing Account Anyone you wish to add to the Billing Account will need their own Google ID. To add a member to a Billing Project: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add a member to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter their Google ID in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose the appropriate role. Click “SAVE”. 5.5 Set Alerts for Google Billing Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account you want to set alerts for. In the left-hand menu, click “Budgets &amp; alerts”. Click the “Create Budget” tab. Enter a name for your budget, and then choose which projects you want to monitor. Then click “Next”. For Budget Type, select “Specified amount”. Enter the total budget amount for the month (you will set alerts at different thresholds in the next step). Click “Next” (do not click “Finish”). Enter the threshold amounts where you want to receive an alert. We recommend starting with 50% and 90%. You can set other alerts if you prefer. Check the box for “Email alerts to billing admins and users”, then click “Finish”. Now you (as the owner and admin), along with anyone you added with admin or user privileges (e.g. lab managers) will receive alerts when your lab members reach the specified spending thresholds. These emails will be sent to the Gmail accounts associated with the Billing Account. You can edit your budgets at any time by going to Billing &gt; Budgets &amp; alerts, and clicking on the name of the budget you want to edit. 5.6 View Spend for Google Billing You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost Costs are reported at the level of Workspaces, so if there are multiple people using a Workspace, you will not be able to determine which of them was responsible for the charges. The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account. To view spending: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view. Look at the top of the Overview tab to see your month-to-date spending. Scroll further down the Overview tab to show your top projects. Click on the Reports tab to see more detailed information about each of your projects. This is probably the most useful tab for exploring costs of individual projects over time. Click on the Cost table tab to obtain a convenient table of spending per project.
